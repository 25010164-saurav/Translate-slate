    "## 1. Problem Definition & Objective\n",
    "**a. Problem Statement:**\n",
    "A language is not only a mode of communication, it is a roadmap of a culture. Language is a way of transferring knowledge and information. Languages are an integral part of the history of life itself. Language is a way of controlling the world. If we cannot have a proper translation it can result in restricting ideas [cite: 8-10].\n",
    "\n",
    "Effective translation requires identifying the dominant function of a text and adopting the appropriate strategy. Current translation tools often prioritize the literal transfer of factual meaning while stripping away feelings and emotions [cite: 11-13].\n",
    "\n",
    "**b. Objective:**\n",
    "The objective is to develop a Many-to-Many Neural Machine Translation (NMT) system. The specific task is to translate text accurately between six major languages: English, Hindi, Japanese, Chinese, Russian, and French[cite: 14].\n",
    "\n",
    "**c. Real-world Relevance:**\n",
    "This system can be deployed in educational tools, travel assistants, or business communication platforms to bridge linguistic gaps and ensure ideas are not restricted by language barriers."

    "## 2. Data Understanding & Preparation\n",
    "**a. Dataset Source (Pre-trained Model Context):**\n",
    "As this project utilizes a pre-trained Transformer model (`facebook/m2m100_418M`), we do not train on a raw dataset from scratch. The underlying model was trained on large-scale many-to-many datasets (CommonCrawl) covering 100 languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "**b. Input Data:**\n",
    "The \"data\" for this application consists of dynamic text strings input by the user. \n",
    "\n",
    "**c. Preprocessing & Feature Engineering:**\n",
    "The system processes input using a specialized tokenizer (`M2M100Tokenizer`)[cite: 19]. The preprocessing pipeline involves:\n",
    "1.  **Tokenization:** Converting raw text strings into language-specific tokens.\n",
    "2.  **Language Codes:** Managing forced constraints (e.g., `forced_bos_token_id`) to direct the model to the correct target language during inference[cite: 45]."

    "## 3. Model / System Design\n",
    "**a. AI Technique:**\n",
    "We utilize **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** using **Transformers** with the **M2M100** (Many-to-Many) architecture[cite: 22].\n",
    "\n",
    "**b. Architecture Explanation:**\n",
    "The pipeline loads a pre-trained `M2M100ForConditionalGeneration` model. The input text is tokenized, fed into the transformer encoder-decoder structure, and decoded into the target language string.\n",
    "\n",
    "**c. Justification of Design Choices:**\n",
    "Unlike traditional models that require separate models for every language pair (e.g., En-Fr, Fr-En), M2M100 is a single model that can translate directly between any of its supported languages. This significantly reduces computational overhead and avoids the \"English-centric\" bottleneck (translating to English before the target language)[cite: 22, 23, 44]."
